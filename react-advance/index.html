    <p>Why we need react? what facebook cannot able to do, they need to build react?</p>
    <h4>Facebook was facing problem with notification and reaction that were not changing
        in real time, there engineer build a library react. Before react they were using broswer
        DOM which was creating problem if we make any changes all the DOM Tree get reloaded,
        which were creates a problem so facebook/ react engineer develop their own dom called virtual
        DOM, same like
        browser DOM, but that is slightly different, when virtual dom get refreshed, it only
        changes the current changes in the dom tree, instead whole DOMTree, which is effective way.
        This is reason to use react for big applications.
        <h2>Its benefits</h2>
        <p><b>Very very less page reloads</b></p>
        <p><b>extreme use of resueable components</b></p>
        <p><b>very very efficient</b></p>
        <p>React ma sara code khud sy nhi likhna prta, we use components, we create react
            app using create-react-app tool,
            <b>To create React Raw app using <i><b>Vite</b></i></b>
        </p>
    </h4>
    <p>component is a function which return jsx, it has ability to display HTML.
        JSX is very similar to HTML where we use JS and HTML, it looks like HTML but its not
        html in real.
